# @upstash/genrtl-mcp

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fb2d42: Add multi-tenant Microsoft Entra ID validation for MCP tokens. The server now detects inbound Entra v2 tokens by issuer pattern, fetches per-teamspace configuration (`tenantId`, `audience`, `requiredScope`) from the GenRTL app, and verifies the token against the matching tenant's JWKS, enforcing the required scope claim when configured. User resolution happens downstream in the GenRTL app against a pre-provisioned user mapping table — the MCP server only validates. Per-tenant JWKS cache and a 5-minute in-memory config cache keyed by JWT audience reduce overhead under load.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- af6a7b5: Convert the stateless MCP implementation to a stateful one using Redis for session management.

### Patch Changes

- 3d73145: Reduce Redis writes on `refresh` by checking the remaining TTL first and only issuing `EXPIRE` when the session is within one day of expiry.

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 34fda7d: Prompt anonymous users to sign in. After the backend signals (via the `X-GenRTL-Auth-Prompt: 1` response header on `/v2/libs/search` or `/v2/context`) that an anonymous client has crossed the per-IP threshold, the MCP server appends a one-time sign-in invitation to the tool result.
  - Both **stdio** and **HTTP** transports surface the same nudge: a tool-result notice asking the assistant to run `npx grtl setup --<client> --mcp -y` (with `--stdio` appended when the MCP server is running on stdio) after explicit user confirmation. The CLI handles OAuth and writes credentials into the MCP client's config; the user restarts their MCP server / editor to pick up the new credentials.
  - Detects the calling client from `X-GenRTL-Client-IDE` / User-Agent and selects the matching CLI flag (`--cursor`, `--claude`, `--codex`, `--opencode`, `--gemini`); falls back to interactive setup when unknown.
  - HTTP transport remains stateless — the threshold is tracked by the backend (per-IP, 24h TTL), the MCP server only reacts to the signal.

## 2.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 187287c: Accept hallucinated argument names on `tools/call` requests by rewriting them to the canonical names before validation. `userQuery` and `question` are mapped to `query` on either tool; on `query-docs`, `genrtlCompatibleLibraryID`, `libraryID`, and `libraryName` are mapped to `libraryId`. Some LLM clients produce these alternative names — likely echoing phrasing from each tool's description — and previously triggered `Invalid input: expected string, received undefined` errors. `libraryName` is only rewritten on `query-docs` calls because it is the canonical arg for `resolve-library-id`. Tool input schemas published via `tools/list` are unchanged: canonical names remain the documented required fields, the rewrite is purely a server-side compatibility shim that runs only on `tools/call` and only when the canonical key is absent.
- 78b9826: Exit the stdio MCP server when the parent process closes its stdio. Previously, if the parent (e.g. Claude Code) was force-killed shortly after a tool call, an idle undici keep-alive socket to the GenRTL API would keep libuv's event loop alive past stdin EOF, leaving an orphaned `node` process that consumed memory until the kernel tore the socket down (which on Cloudflare-fronted endpoints can take hours). The server now listens for `end`/`close` on stdin and `SIGHUP` and exits cleanly. Fixes #2542.

## 2.2.4

### Patch Changes

- d0e4a48: Create a fresh `McpServer` per HTTP request. Sharing one across requests let any concurrent `transport.close` clear the shared `Protocol._transport`, which broke `sendNotification` for in-flight long-running tool calls.
- 1aa3430: Remove research mode entirely from the MCP server and CLI. The `query-docs` MCP tool no longer accepts or forwards a `researchMode` parameter, and the CLI no longer exposes a `--research` flag on `grtl docs`.

## 2.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 772da3a: Stream MCP tool responses over SSE so HTTP headers flush before client `fetch` timeouts. Switching `enableJsonResponse` to `false` makes the SDK return the HTTP response synchronously after request validation, so headers are sent in milliseconds instead of being buffered until the tool completes. This fixes clients that cap the underlying `fetch` waiting for headers (e.g., Claude Code's 60s `wrapFetchWithTimeout`).

## 2.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 8274bd0: Add missing tool annotations
- ff6c1be: Remove the `researchMode` parameter from the `query-docs` tool's input schema. The underlying API still supports research mode, but several MCP clients hit per-request timeouts (60s defaults) on long-running research calls in ways that can't always be solved server-side. Hiding the parameter prevents agents from invoking it through MCP until the timeout story is reliable across clients.
